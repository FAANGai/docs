Recruitment today is evolving at lightning speed. Traditional manual interviews and sourcing methods are slow, costly, and prone to bias. That’s why we built **Asendia AI**:

- **AI Interviewing Agent**: Automated voice and video interviews that pre-qualify candidates 24/7, with fraud detection and scoring built in.
- **AI Sourcing Agent**: Smart sourcing that continuously finds, filters, and enriches talent, feeding them directly into your ATS.

## Our Mission

At Asendia AI, our mission is simple:
