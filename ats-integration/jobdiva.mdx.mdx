## JobDiva Integration – Customer Guides

Below you’ll find **two** short, non‑technical guides:

1. **Connecting JobDiva to Our Platform** – what you need to do once.
2. **What Happens After You Connect** – how everything works automatically.

## **1. Setup & Configuration**

### **Connect JobDiva**

First, ensure your JobDiva organization is connected to Asendia. You will need:

- **Client ID**
- **Username**
- **Password**

### Set up **JobDiva** custom fields

1. **Go to JobDiva and add new user-defined fields for the job**

### **Enable AI Interviews (Hybrid Mode)**

To enable AI interviews for a specific job, you need to configure **User Fields** in JobDiva.

1. **Open a Job** in JobDiva.
2. Locate the **User Fields** section (or Custom Fields).
3. Add/Update the following fields:
   - **Hybrid interview enabled**: Set to `Yes`, `yes`
   - **Hybrid Interview Questions**: Enter your custom interview questions here.
     - _Format_: Numbered list (e.g., `1. Tell me about yourself. 2. What is your experience with Python?`) or separate with new lines.

> Note: If "Hybrid interview enabled" is set to No or left blank, the system may default to a standard AI-Dynamic interview based on the job description.

## **2. Triggering the Interview**

aOnce the integration is active and the job is set up:

1. **Triggering the Interview**: You have to go to Talent Pipeline, drag the candidate from one stage to `Asendia Interview`

1. **Invitation**: The candidate automatically receives an email invitation with a secure **Magic Link**.
2. **Verification**: The candidate clicks the link and verifies their identity (using their email) to access the AI Interview portal.

## **3. Post-Interview Results**

After the candidate completes the AI interview, the results are automatically synced back to JobDiva.

### **Where to find results:**

- **Candidate Notes**: A new note is created in the candidate's profile.
  - **Subject**: "AI Interview Assessment - [Job Title]"
  - **Content**: Contains a summary of the interview.
- **Attachments**:
  - **PDF Report**: A comprehensive "Interview Assessment Report" is attached to the note/candidate record. This includes the AI's evaluation, scores, and transcript summary.
  - **Video Recording**: A link to the full video recording of the interview is provided in the note.

### **Triggers Summary**
