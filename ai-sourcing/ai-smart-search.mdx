## Introduction to Semantic Search

- What is semantic search
- How it differs from a keyword or Boolean search
- Why modern AI sourcing relies on context, meaning, and relationships between skills, experiences, and roles
- The evolution from keyword-matching to contextual understanding

---

## How Semantic Search Works

- The AI analyzes candidate data, job descriptions, and contextual signals using large language models (LLMs)
- Concepts like vector embeddings and similarity scoring
- How the system understands synonyms, related skills, and domain context (e.g., “RN” ≈ “Registered Nurse”)
- Continuous learning — improving as more searches and hires occur

## Semantic Search vs. Boolean Search: A Comparison

| Feature           | Boolean / Keyword Search                 | Semantic (Smart) Search                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Logic             | Matches exact words or Boolean operators | Understands context, meaning, and intent             |
| Skill Recognition | Requires manual inclusion of synonyms    | Automatically expands related skills                 |
| Example           | “(nurse OR RN) AND ‘emergency room’”     | “Emergency room nurse” → finds all relevant profiles |
| Maintenance       | High manual effort                       | Adaptive and self-improving                          |
| Accuracy          | Often broad or irrelevant                | High-precision matching based on contextual fit      |

## Case Study: LinkedIn Recruiter vs. Asendia AI Semantic Search

**Example scenario:**

- Boolean search in LinkedIn Recruiter:\
  `("registered nurse" OR "RN") AND ("emergency room" OR "ER") AND ("Arizona")`\
  → Returns candidates with matching keywords, but misses profiles with similar experiences written differently.
- Asendia AI Semantic Search:\
  Input: “Experienced ER nurse with trauma background in Arizona”\
  → Returns candidates with matching experience descriptions even if they never used “ER” or “trauma” explicitly — e.g. “Level 1 hospital nurse,” “critical care nurse,” etc.

**Result:**\
Asendia AI delivers _contextually relevant_ matches, not just keyword hits.
