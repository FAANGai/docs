### **Overview**

Semantic search analyzes meaning behind words to uncover the best-fit talent faster — understanding skills, experience, and context beyond simple keyword matches.

### **Data Foundation**

Asendia AI’s sourcing engine is powered by a **global database of over 200 million professional profiles**, aggregated from **public and compliant data sources**.\
Through partnerships with trusted data providers, Asendia AI compiles candidate information from verified sources such as **LinkedIn, public resumes, and professional networks**, enriched with available **contact details (phone number and email)**.

This comprehensive dataset enables the AI to perform deep semantic analysis across massive talent pools, ensuring each search delivers accurate, up-to-date, and actionable results.

## **1. Natural Language Input**

Recruiters can describe the role naturally, just as they would explain it to a colleague.\
For example:

> “Find senior full-stack engineers experienced with React, Node.js, and cloud deployment.”

The AI interprets this intent, extracts the relevant entities, such as **role, skills, experience level, and technologies,** and transforms them into structured filters.\
No Boolean syntax is required; the system understands the recruiter’s intent behind the words.

## **Extracted Filters**

After the recruiter submits the search, the AI displays a **Filters Tab** that visualizes all extracted criteria, such as:

- **Role:** Full-Stack Engineer
- **Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, AWS
- **Seniority:** Senior
- **Location:** Remote or specific geography
- **Experience:** 5+ years

This helps recruiters validate and adjust the AI’s interpretation before running the full semantic search.

## **Filters Page Explained**

The **Filters Page** gives full visibility and control. It’s organized into sections that matter most for engineering searches:

- **Core Role Filters:** Job title, specialization (e.g., Backend, DevOps, Frontend)
- **Technical Skills:** Languages, frameworks, cloud platforms, and tools
- **Experience Filters:** Years of experience, seniority, or domain (e.g., fintech, healthtech)
- **Location & Work Type:** On-site, hybrid, remote, or region-specific

Recruiters can fine-tune or expand these filters, and the AI instantly adapts the sourcing logic.

## **4. AI Matching Process**

The sourcing engine uses a **two-step ranking system** to ensure precision in technical talent matching:

1. **Ranking:** Scores candidates based on direct keyword and metadata relevance (e.g., exact skills, titles, and experience).
2. **Re-ranking:** Applies deep semantic understanding to analyze project descriptions, role context, and related technologies — identifying candidates who may use different terminology but have equivalent experience (e.g., “TypeScript” ≈ “JavaScript,” “GCP” ≈ “AWS”).

This hybrid approach captures hidden talent often missed by Boolean search.

## **5. Search Results**

The results show a ranked list of engineering candidates, each with:

- **Fit Score:** AI-calculated probability of match
- **Top Skills & Technologies:** Automatically highlighted from their experience
- **Contextual Summary:** Why they fit the specific role based on projects, frameworks, and industry background

Recruiters can click on profiles to review experience, see AI-generated summaries, and take action directly from their ATS.
