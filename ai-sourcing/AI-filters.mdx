## Overview

The **Filters Page** in Asendia AI allows recruiters to refine and control the parameters of their candidate search.\
After entering a natural-language prompt, the AI automatically generates filters based on the recruiter’s intent — these filters can then be reviewed, edited, or expanded before running the search.

---

## **Filter Categories**

### **1. Job Role**

Define the target position and related responsibilities.\
The AI automatically detects and populates job titles, role keywords, and categories.\
**Example:**

- Job Role: `Senior Full-Stack Engineer`
- AI-Generated Keywords: `full-stack, engineer, architecture, cloud, web`
- Category: `Technology`
- Function: `Engineer`

Recruiters can enter up to five roles per search, separated by commas, to expand sourcing coverage.

### **2. Location**

Set geographic preferences and restrictions for candidates.\
You can specify city, state, country, or choose remote-ready options.\
**Example:**\
`San Francisco, CA` · `New York City` · `Remote (US-based)`

The AI automatically includes nearby metropolitan areas if relevant to the search.

---

### **3. Experience**

Define years of experience, seniority, and position level.\
Common tiers include:

- Entry-Level
- Mid-Level
- Senior
- Lead / Principal

The AI also interprets phrases like _“experienced in DevOps”_ or _“junior backend engineer”_ directly from the recruiter’s input.

---

### **4. Skills & Keywords**

Highlight the technical or domain skills required for the role.\
The AI extracts these automatically and groups related concepts.\
**Example:**\
If the recruiter writes _“React and Node.js engineer with cloud deployment experience”_,\
the filters might include:

- React
- Node.js
- AWS / GCP
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Cloud Infrastructure

Recruiters can add or remove skills manually at any time.

---

### **5. Company**

Target candidates from specific companies or industries.\
Useful for competitive sourcing, benchmarking, or identifying professionals from certain market sectors.\
**Example:**\
`Amazon, Meta, Stripe, early-stage startups`

### **6. Education**

Add filters for academic background, degree level, or field of study.\
**Example:**

- Degree: `B.Sc. or higher`
- Field: `Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science`
- Institution: optional filter (e.g., “top-tier universities”)

### **7. Additional Filters**

Fine-tune your results using optional advanced filters such as:

- **Availability:** Actively open to work / Passive candidates
- **Last Activity:** Recently updated profiles
- **Languages:** Spoken or programming languages
- **Visa / Work Authorization:** When available from public data

## **AI-Generated vs. Manual Filters**

Each filter begins as **AI-generated** from your natural language search.\
Recruiters can then manually edit or remove filters to customize the search further.\
Changes are instantly reflected in the matching and ranking process.
