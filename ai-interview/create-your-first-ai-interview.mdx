## Inputs Sarah Uses to Power the Interview

When you create an AI interview, Sarah receives a rich set of inputs:

- **Job Description**: Defines the responsibilities, skills, and requirements for the role.
- **Candidate Resume**: Provides context on the candidate’s background, experience, and education.
- **Company Data**: Pulled from your Company Profile (brand voice, culture, benefits, values, etc.).
- **Interview Type Selection**: Dynamic, Hybrid, or Pre-Defined mode determines how Sarah structures questions.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Role-specific dimensions (e.g., technical skills, communication, leadership) for structured scoring.
- **Custom Questions**: Recruiter-mandated or client-specific questions for compliance and consistency.

📌 These inputs work together to make Sarah’s interviews **context-aware, adaptive, and personalized**.
