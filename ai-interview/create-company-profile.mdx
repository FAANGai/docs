## Getting Started

Your **Company Profile** is the foundation of how Sarah, the AI recruiter, understands your organization. By providing context about your company’s identity, culture, and values, you enable Sarah to deliver interviews that are not only smart but also **personalized and brand-aligned**.

Instead of candidates facing a generic AI, they’ll engage with an interview experience that reflects **your company’s mission, tone, and culture** — creating stronger candidate trust and higher conversion rates.

Perfect, thanks for sharing the screenshots — they make it crystal clear how the **Company Profile creation flow** is structured. Let’s turn this into a polished **documentation page** that explains the **overview, goals, and each step** recruiters will follow when setting up their company profile.

## Goals of Setting Up a Company Profile

- **Give Context to Sarah**\
  The more Sarah knows about your agency or client, the more relevant and adaptive her questions and closing pitches become.
- **Ensure Consistency**\
  Every candidate receives the same brand-aligned messaging, no matter which recruiter triggers the interview.
- **Promote Your Brand**\
  Interviews showcase your agency’s identity, values, and benefits, turning every interaction into a subtle pitch.
- **Enhance Candidate Experience**\
  Candidates feel valued and engaged because Sarah communicates with context, not generic prompts.
