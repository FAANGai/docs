The **AI Interview Agent** is not a simple automation script — it’s the world’s first **self-learning recruiter**, designed to think, adapt, and evolve with every interaction. Powered by cutting-edge voice AI and adaptive intelligence, it transforms interviews from rigid Q&A sessions into **smart, dynamic conversations**.

Staffing agencies no longer need to choose between **scale** and **quality**. With Asendia AI, you can have both.

---

## Why It’s a Game-Changer

Traditional screening calls are expensive, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. Asendia AI redefines the process by delivering:

- **24/7 availability** — interviews can run at any time, across time zones.
- **Fraud-proof verification** — ensuring every candidate is who they say they are.
- **Adaptive intelligence** — interviews that flex based on the role, company, and candidate.
- **End-to-end ATS integration** — recruiters don’t change workflows, only outcomes.

With this, agencies reduce screening costs from **\$30 to \$3 per interview** while **placing talent faster** and with more confidence.

## How It Works

3. **Deep Analysis**
   - AI evaluates content, tone, and context.
   - Fraud detection ensures authenticity.
   - Smart scoring highlights top performers.
4. **Recruiter Empowerment**
   - Updates with a **candidate scorecard**, transcripts, audio/video, and fraud reports.
   - Recruiters instantly see which candidates are worth advancing.

## Interview Types — Innovation in Action

### 1. Dynamic Interviews (Next-Gen Adaptive AI)

Sarah generates **context-aware questions in real-time** — adapting to:

- Job description and company requirements
- Candidate’s resume and background
- Live responses during the interview

This creates a natural, personalized conversation — something no static system can deliver.

You can now Scale personalized interviews across thousands of candidates without recruiter effort.

---

### 2. Hybrid Interviews (Best of Both Worlds)

Recruiters define **mandatory questions** (compliance, technical, client-specific). Sarah then **builds around them dynamically**, asking follow-ups and probing intelligently.

Recruiters stay in control while still benefiting from AI-driven adaptability.

---

### 3. Pre-Defined Interviews (Full Control)

Recruiters provide the exact script. Sarah delivers it consistently, while still adding Asendia AI’s power — scoring, transcripts, fraud checks, and ATS sync.

Even in regulated or client-driven environments, recruiters get AI-powered insights layered on top of traditional scripts.

After every interview, the platform delivers a **Recruiter Intelligence Pack**:

- **Smart Score (0–100)** weighted to the role.

- **Full Recording & Transcript** for transparency.
- **Fraud Detection Report** to eliminate risks.
- **ATS Sync** with structured data ready for client submission.

---

## Why Recruitment teams Love It

- **Superhuman Scalability:** Run 1,000 interviews in parallel, each uniquely adaptive.
- **Bias-Free Evaluation:** Consistent scoring and summaries for every candidate.
- **Faster Placements:** Recruiters focus on top talent, not screening calls.
- **Stronger Client Trust:** Share structured, fraud-verified candidate reports.

## Example in Action

> A healthcare staffing agency moves 500 candidates into the “AI Interview” stage in Tracker. Overnight, Sarah conducts personalized interviews, flags fraud, ranks candidates, and syncs structured results back into Tracker. By morning, recruiters know exactly which 50 are top-fit and ready to submit to hiring managers.

This is the **new standard of staffing efficiency.**

🔥 **Asendia AI isn’t just automating interviews — it’s reinventing them.**
